    <!-- In this code, we first select all the images with the class name "slide" and set the 
    currentSlide variable to 0. We then set up a slideInterval using the setInterval() function
    that calls the nextSlide function every 3000 milliseconds (or 3 seconds).

The nextSlide function removes the "active" class from the current slide, updates the currentSlide
variable to the next slide in the sequence (wrapping around to the first slide if we've reached the end), 
and adds the "active" class to the new current slide.

The CSS code positions the slides absolutely on top of each other and sets their initial opacity to 0. 
The "active" class sets the opacity to 1, creating the fade effect when it's applied to a slide.

Note that you'll need to adjust the CSS styles to position the slideshow and control its size and 
appearance as needed. -->
